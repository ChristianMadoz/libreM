# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented Vercel Web Analytics for the Create React App (CRA) project by adding the `@vercel/analytics` package and integrating the Analytics component.

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed Dependencies
- Added `@vercel/analytics` package (version ^1.6.1) to the project dependencies
- Updated `package-lock.json` to reflect the new dependency

### 2. Modified Files

#### `src/App.js`
- Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/react';`
- Added the `<Analytics />` component to the JSX tree, positioned alongside the existing `<SpeedInsights />` component
- The Analytics component is placed inside all context providers (AuthProvider and CartProvider) to ensure it tracks all user interactions properly

### 3. Implementation Details
- Framework: Create React App (CRA) with React Router
- Integration method: Added the Analytics component wrapper as per the official Vercel Web Analytics guide for React applications
- The Analytics component automatically tracks page views and provides route support with react-router-dom
- The component is placed near the end of the component tree (before SpeedInsights) to ensure it captures all routing events

## Testing
- Successfully ran `npm run build` to verify the build completes without errors
- Build output confirmed successful compilation with no issues
- The implementation follows the official Vercel Web Analytics guide for Create React App projects

## Next Steps
Once deployed to Vercel:
1. Enable Web Analytics in the Vercel dashboard under the Analytics tab
2. Verify the `/_vercel/insights/view` endpoint appears in the browser's Network tab
3. View analytics data in the Vercel dashboard after deployment and user visits

## Notes
- The project already had `@vercel/speed-insights` installed, so the Analytics component was added alongside it
- No breaking changes were introduced
- The implementation maintains existing code structure and patterns
- All lock files have been properly updated to ensure consistent dependency resolution
